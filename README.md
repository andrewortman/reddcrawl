# reddcrawl
Java/Spring implementation of my reddit crawler / archiver. Used to catch back up on Java/Spring. The ultimate goal is to use ML to "predict the future" on reddit.. my hypothesis is that the human behavior on reddit is highly predictable given a set of features extracted from the dataset curated by reddcrawl
